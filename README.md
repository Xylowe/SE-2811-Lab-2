# SE-2811-Lab-2

Repository for Lab 2 in the SE 2811 Class

---

The overall objective for this lab includes creating a flower bed simulator. This simulator contains different kinds of both flowers and bees. As the time progresses, the bees travel around the garden looking for flowers and slowly loses energy. Once the bee finds a flower, it lands and gains energy from that flower. After the flowerâ€™s energy is depleted, the bee moves on to a new flower. Bees can travel in different paths in order to find flowers and the collision of bees will result in the reduction of energy from one or both bees.
